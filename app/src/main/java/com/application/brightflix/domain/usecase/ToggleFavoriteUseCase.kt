 * Adds or removes a movie from favorites, whichever applies.
 *
 * Callers pass the movie and get back the resulting state; they never have to read the
 * current one first. Centralising the read-then-branch means the toggle behaves identically
 * from Home, Search, Detail and Favorites, and the "is it saved?" check cannot drift out of
 * sync with the write that follows it.
 *
 * @return true if the movie is now saved, false if it was removed. Useful for announcing
 *   the outcome to accessibility services and for confirmation messaging.
